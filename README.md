# App Rating Prediction

In this project, I developed a model to predict app ratings based on various app information. 
The dataset used was the Google Play Store data, which included fields such as app category, reviews, size, installs, and more. 
I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and built a linear regression model to predict app ratings.
